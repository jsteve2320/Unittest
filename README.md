# Unit Tests – Control Work

Hi! I'm **Jeremy**, a first-year student learning programming.  
This is a simple project where I wrote **unit tests** for the exercises from my control (exam) work.

I'm using:
- **C#**
- **.NET**
- **NUnit** for testing

##  What’s inside?

Each file in this project contains tests for one of the tasks I had to solve.  
The goal is to check that my code works correctly for different inputs.

##  How to run

1. Open the terminal
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/boris-ec/UnitTests.git
